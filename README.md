# Disaster-Management-Systerm-LLM üå™Ô∏è

This Disaster Management System is a Streamlit-based application that uses Google Generative AI models via LangChain to simulate, analyze, and manage various natural disaster scenarios. The project enables users to simulate disaster scenarios, generate summaries, devise prevention measures, and create evacuation plans, providing an insightful tool for disaster management and risk assessment.

# Features
Disaster Simulation: Users can enter a type of disaster (e.g., flood, earthquake) to generate a detailed disaster scenario based on predictive data.
Scenario Summarization: Summarizes the generated scenario, highlighting key challenges, affected areas, and immediate consequences.
Prevention Measures: Provides tailored prevention and response strategies to mitigate disaster impact.
Evacuation Planning: Generates evacuation plans and safe zones for affected areas.
Risk Assessment: Conducts a risk assessment and vulnerability analysis for the disaster scenario.

# Technologies Used
Streamlit: For building the interactive user interface.
LangChain: Manages the Large Language Models (LLMs) workflow and prompt templates.
Google Generative AI (Gemini-Pro): Provides AI-powered responses for generating and analyzing disaster scenarios.
